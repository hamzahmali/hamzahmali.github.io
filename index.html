  <h1>The Legend Of Zelda - First Dungeon</h1>
  <h2>By Hamzah Ali</h2>
  <h3>Partners: Joshua Ma, Vera Sivrieva</h3>

  <p>
    This project is a recreation of the first dungeon of the classic Nintendo game
    <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. The goal was to recreate the feel and structure
    of the NES game using Unity and C#.

  <h3>My Contributions</h3>

  <h4>Health, Damage, Knockback, and Hit Flash</h4>
  <p>
    I implemented the health and damage system for both the player and enemies.
    I also added knockback and a visual hit flash effect so combat feels more responsive.

  <h4>Room Transitions</h4>
  <p>
    I created the room transition system that moves the player between rooms
    using doors, matching the flow of the original Zelda game.

  <h4>Boomerang</h4>
  <p>
    I built the boomerang weapon, including throwing, returning, and interactions
    with enemies and objects.

  <h4>Fishing Rod Item Pickup</h4>
  <p>
    I modified the fishing rod so it can pick up items, allowing players to
    interact with the environment in new ways.

    original game.

  <h4>Level Building</h4>
  <p>
    I built the game levels by placing enemies and items to match the original
    Legend of Zelda level design.

  <h4>Pull Blocks</h4>
  <p>
    I implemented a feature with the fishing rod to be able to pull blocks around.
    These blocks can be dropped into the water and can be walked on.
  </p>

  <h4>Designed Custom Level</h4>
  <p>
    I designed several rooms and put them together to showcase our fishing rod.
    I created rooms that display how the fishing rod can pull in enemies, collect items,
    and pull blocks.
